#requirement: type should be element symbol instead of number. point charge should be labelled as "F"
#             the configuration does not have periodic boundary

#argument 1: QM_string definition of the QM zone. can be anything that vmd recognize
#argument 2: active_string. region 3
#argument 3: ecp_string the definition of potential group. i.e. "type Ti" or "none"
#argument 4: charge of the ecp
#argument 5: name i.e. "CaO2"
#argument 6: partial or formal charge scheme. either "p" or "f"

#partial charge scheme:
#   region 1: QM atom, with charge 0
#   region 2: potential, use partial charge or formal charge
#
#   compensated charge computed from: region 1 original charge + region 2 current charge
#   delta charge: compensated charge divided by the number of atoms in region 3 and region 4
#
#   region 3: active MM, use partial charge, and partial charge shell
#   region 4: frozen MM, use original charge, no shell

#formal charge scheme:
#   region 1: QM atom, with charge 0
#   region 2: potential, use partial charge or formal charge
#
#   compensated charge computed from: region 1 original charge + region 2 current charge
#   delta charge: compensated charge divided by the number of atoms in region 3 and region 4
#
#   region 3: active MM, each 
#   region 4: frozen MM, use original charge
