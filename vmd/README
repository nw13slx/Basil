addbond.tcl

    addbond (type1, type2, R1, R2) function is  used to add bonds to the A-B atom 
    pairs that have is in the range of (R1,R2). A, B should be a type name and 
    (R1,R2) is the minimum/maximum cut-off radius. If the bond already exist, it 
    will delete the bond and re-add it. It shouldn't be too hard to change A and B 
    into random selection defined by "atomselect"
   
    deletebond (type1, type2, R1, R2) function is to undo the above function.
   
    no periodic boundary condition is counted. see more notes in the code.
