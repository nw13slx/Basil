ORCA post-analysis code

PDOS.cpp:
  analyse the "Print[ P_MOs ] 1" output of ORCA. 
    The density of state will be decomposed to 
    different element and different angular momentum , s p d f
    this is called PDOS in the solid state dft community
  usage: g++ PDOS.cpp -o PDOS
         PDOS <inputfile name> <outputfile name> 

convert_poscar
   read the orca output and convert the atomic 
   configuration to POSCAR format.
   Q+ will be label as F and Q- will be label as N
   embedding potential is labeled as La
   
   usage: g++ convert_poscar.cpp -o conv_pos
          conv_pos <inputfile name> <outputfile name>
